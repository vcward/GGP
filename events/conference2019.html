                    <h5><strong>University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa<br>
East West Center -- Pacific Room (<a href=https://www.eastwestcenter.org/about-ewc/housing/frequently-asked-questions="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">directions and map</a>)</strong></h5>
                    <p>GGP’s goal is to hasten a fair and efficient transformation to renewable energy by focusing on the institutional changes needed to better manage the intermittency of renewable energy. Earlier conferences focused on inefficiencies of current policies, the need for improved rate design to incentivize load shifting and demand response, and challenges with aligning utility and public interests. This year GGP will hone in on more specific obstacles to pragmatic changes toward policies often favored by experts but remain elusive in actual policy, both in Hawaii and other regions experiencing rapid renewable energy transitions. </p>
                    <p>KEYNOTE:  Richard Schmalensee. 
                            Issues/challenges/policy considerations brought about by intermittent renewable energy and storage, all put in context with historical evolution of electricity regulation and markets. Comparisons between Hawai’i and California will be emphasized.
                            </p>
                    <p>Six panels/sessions:<p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1. Managing Obstacles to Major Institutional Transitions
                                This session will focus on key issues than need to be addressed in moving from a traditional electricity system to one that relies heavily intermittent renewable energy sources. It is difficult to discuss transition issues without some shared sense of the goal. To prepare for this session requests have been sent to about fifteen knowledgeable people. We asked these experts two questions    
                        </li>
                        <li> Describe three or more key elements of an ideal high-renewable electricity system of the future? By “ideal” we mean a clean energy system that is cost effective, fair, sustainable, and efficiently managed—plus other criteria you want to include.</li>
                        <li> Which of the elements described in 1. apply to systems in places like Hawai‘i that are small, vertically integrated, managed by investor-owned utilities, and lack regional interconnections? What other elements do you think should be part of these systems. </li>
                        <li> Responses will be treated anonymously and merged into something that can be used to focus on transition processes. The panel will be asked to address questions formulated ahead of the session and then interact with audience observations, comments and questions. Panel members from outside will be chosen from those already invited and joined by others from Hawai‘i.</li>

                        <li>2. Local Carbon Taxes: Challenges, Impacts, and Interaction with RPS
                                    Many states are considering carbon taxes and/or cap-and-trade programs in order to limit greenhouse gas emissions in lieu of national and international policies that may not be forthcoming. What are the challenges of implementing local carbon taxes, especially in regard to trade in energy and other goods with other states, and appropriately accounting for the life-cycle of emissions? What are the best ways to recycle revenues from carbon taxes to minimize economic impact and maximize fairness? How can these policies be thoughtfully integrated with existing policies designed to limit greenhouse gas emissions, like renewable portfolio standards (RPS) and renewable energy tax credits? </li>
                        <li>SESSION ORGANIZERS: Makena Coffman & Michael Roberts </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>3. Making Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions Fair and Equitable.
                                How can policies that encourage growth of renewables and reduced greenhouse gas emissions be more equitable? Tax credits, net metering agreements, and energy efficiency subsidies have implicitly favored the wealthy. Policies intended to direct benefits to lower income families have had largely failed. Would more efficient policies be more equitable? (e.g., carbon tax, higher customer charges, and ‘true value’ pricing of solar backfeeding.) Should equity be a focus of energy / environmental policy, or should inequities be addressed separately (e.g., energy assistance payments to low-income households)? Are the worst inequities a fundamental characteristic of this kind of change or a byproduct of inefficient policies that have been politically acceptable up to this point in time?

                        <li>4. Integrated Resource Planning
                                Planning high-renewable systems is more complex than traditional fossil systems centered on rampable thermal power plants. New models and software are needed that can simultaneously optimize: (i) a portfolio of intermittent and flexible generation resources, (ii) storage, (iii) demand response and other distributed resources, (iv) transmission. There is stronger interaction between operation and long-term investment decisions, which matters because performance-based mechanisms that focus on controlling operations costs (price/revenue caps) may conflict with incentives for better long-run investment. How can policy makers motivate and implement the best integrated solutions? How does this differ in places with and without markets (like Hawai‘i)?

                        <li>5. Managing Obsolescence and Stranded Assets
                                New technology often renders old assets obsolete. In regulated environments, however, obsolescence is as much a policy decision as an economic one. The structure of wholesale markets, subsidies for certain types of power (e.g., renewables or nuclear), or top-down regulatory and utility decisions, all factor into whether assets are kept online, the revenues assets receive, and who pays. How should we decide which assets to retire and when to retire them? How should revenues to assets be determined? What’s wrong with current rules governing these decisions, and how can these rules be improved? In the event of substantial grid defection, who pays for the stranded assets, including the grid of unused or partially used wires?

                    <ul>
                        <li>6. Rate of Return Regulation: What are the Alternatives?
                                Cost-of-service or rate-of-return regulation (RRR) underpins most capital investment by investor-owned regulated utilities. There is growing recognition that inefficiencies of RRR become more acute with increasingly complex planning and investment decisions that surround high-penetration renewables (see sessions above). If the rate of return is set too high, the utility has an incentive to overinvest and/or mis invest, while simultaneously under-utilizing independent generation and distributed resources. If the rate of return is set too low, bankruptcy could ensue, and there may be State liability under Supreme Court precedent. Are there viable alternatives to RRR in places where markets are not viable (e.g., distribution and small-scale systems like Hawai’i’s)? Have performance-based incentives been helpful, or simply a way to boost utility profit? If RRR is unavoidable, how can perverse incentives be minimized? How can we get the allowed rate of return "right"—as close as possible to the true cost of capital?
